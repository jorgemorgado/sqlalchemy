"""
Illustrates how to run many statements concurrently using ``asyncio.gather()``
along many asyncio database connections, merging ORM results into a single
``AsyncSession``.

Note that this pattern loses all transactional safety and is also not
necessarily any more performant than using a single Session, as it adds
significant CPU-bound work both to maintain more database connections
and sessions, as well as within the merging of results from external sessions
into one.

Python is a CPU-intensive language even in trivial cases, so it is strongly
recommended that any workarounds for "speed" such as the one below are
carefully vetted to show that they do in fact improve performance vs a
traditional approach.
